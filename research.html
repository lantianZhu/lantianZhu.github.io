<strong>How the market segmentation affect the regional economic resilience?</a></strong>, forthcoming, <i>Statistics&Decesion</i>, 2023<br>with YangGe;<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Strengthening economic resilience and ensuring steady and sustained economic development are important goals for China as it enters a new stage of development. Building a unified market and breaking down the regional market segmentation is the internal requirement of building a new development stage. This paper theoretically analyzes the internal logic of the impact of market segmentation on regional economic resilience, and empirically tests it using China's provincial panel data from 2005 to 2019. It is found that market segmentation has a significant adverse effect on economic resilience, which is still significant after a series of robustness tests excluding the endogeneity problem. Mechanism test shows that regional market segmentation will affect economic resilience by inhibiting manufacturing scale and regional innovation capacity, and market segmentation will also make infrastructure investment tend to be inefficient, which will affect economic resilience. The negative effect of market segmentation on economic resilience is strengthened in regions with a high degree of private and individual enterprise development; With the transformation and upgrading of industrial structure, the destruction of market function caused by market segmentation will intensify the adverse impact on economic resilience. The development of digital economy is an effective way to alleviate the negative impact of market segmentation.  </p>

<strong><a href="https://lantianzhu.github.io/files/abstract1.pdf">Market Determinism, Government Transformation and Government Economics with Chinese Characteristics</a></strong>,forthcoming, <i>Qinghai Social Science<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>This paper discusses the revolutionary significance of giving full play to the decisive role of the market in resource allocation and the role of the government in perfecting the socialist market economy system with Chinese characteristics pointed out in the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China; the core issue of "market determinism" is the relationship between the government and the market, and the reorientation of government functions and the transformation of government are the core of contemporary China's economic system reform "Market determinism" does not weaken government functions, but puts forward higher requirements for government functions. It is an urgent academic task to construct government economics with Chinese characteristics. The paper also puts forward corresponding suggestions on the research content, discipline construction and scientific research cooperation of government economics with Chinese characteristics.</p>

<strong><a href="https://lantianzhu.github.io/files/abstract3.pdf"></a>How does the Primacy of Provincial Capital Cities Affect Regional Economic Resilience—— Facts and Explanations in China</strong><br>with Yongfeng Zhang, JianPing Zhang;<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>This dissertation explores how the primacy of provincial capital cities have an impact on regional economic resilience based on China's provincial panel data from 2005 to 2018 and analyze the mechanism of its impact on regional economic resilience deeply. The results show that the primacy of provincial capital cities has an inverted U-shaped impact on regional economic resilience.For now, the primacy of most provinces in China is still in the range of positive impact.The primacy will affect regional economic resilience by affecting the degree of regional integration and regional resource mismatch specifically.After solving the interference of endogenous problems and conducting multiple robustness tests, the inverted U-shaped impact is still significant. The heterogeneity test based on natural endowment and political resources demonstrates that, this inverted U-shaped relationship is still significant in inland provinces and those areas with only one central city, while it is not significant in coastal provinces and provinces with multiple central cities.The conclusion of this dissertation shows that, it is invalid in the long run just to bulid a mega capital city based on the target of improving regional economic resilience, but it is still an effective policy in a short term. For provinces which are short in natural endowment and political resources, it is a practical way to promote the general economic resilience through the strategy of strengthening provincial city primacy.</p><br>

<strong><a href="https://lantianzhu.github.io/files/abstract4.pdf"></a>Research on the Degree of Financialization in China</strong><br>with JianPing Zhang;<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>The report of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China put forward that the focus of economic development should be placed on the real economy. This paper has explored and explained the logic of financial sector, non-financial sector and product (factor) financialization in turn, and believes that the three levels of financialization are still in line with the nature of capital pursuit, which can further reflect the increasing demand of economic entities for diversified financial structures, The scale of China's financial industry has expanded significantly and the financial system structure has become increasingly mature; From the perspective of the characteristics of non-financial enterprises' financialization, the degree of financing financialization is relatively obvious, while the degree of investment financialization and profit financialization has dropped, that is, the degree of non-financial enterprises' financialization has a certain heterogeneity; From the perspective of the characteristics of product (factor) financialization in the macro-economy, the degree of land factor financialization is deepening. Comprehensively and objectively understand the deep logic of China's financialization and accept the profit seeking nature of capital. Rational formation of the concept of financialization can promote the construction of a diversified and market-oriented financial system. On the basis of preventing excessive financialization, it can anchor the purpose of "good finance" serving the real economy and the national economy and the people's livelihood.</p><br>
