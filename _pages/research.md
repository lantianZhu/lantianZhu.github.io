Allocating innovation resources to their most productive uses is a challenge for innovators because they have incomplete information about which projects will be most productive. I empirically study how a group of large scientific labs traded off the exploitation of existing opportunities
versus the exploration of new ones, that is whether they pursued safe projects to maximize short-term productivity or undertook high-variance projects to acquire information and improve long-term productivity. To recover how these labs made the exploitation-exploration tradeoff, I estimate a dynamic model of decision-making, assuming the labs approximated the value of exploration with a simple Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) index. The type of index is well-studied in theory and well-used in practice but has not been applied to estimation of empirical decision models. The index model captures the labs’ decision-making well. Estimates of its free parameters suggest that the labs explored extensively. Counterfactual simulations show that, had the labs not explored, their output quantity would have decreased by 51%, and their citations would have decreased by 57%.

The increasing demand for empirical rigor has led to the growing use of auxiliary tests (balance, pre-trends, over-identification, placebo, etc.) to help assess the credibility of a paper’s main results. We dub these “sniff tests” because rejection is bad news for the author and standards for passing are informal. We use these sniff tests—a sample of nearly 30,000 hand collected from scores of economics journals—as a lens to examine selection pressures in the publication process. We derive bounds under plausible nonparametric assumptions on the latent proportion of significant sniff tests removed by the publication process (whether by p-hacking or relegation to the file drawer) and the proportion whose significance was due to true misspecification, not bad luck. For the subsample of balance tests in randomized controlled trials, we find that the publication process removed at least 34.0% of significant p-values. For the subsample of other tests, we find a that at least 42.7% of significant p-values indicated true misspecification. We use textual analysis to assess whether authors over-attribute significant sniff tests to bad luck.

**Market segmentation and Chinese debt**

We study how supply capacity coordination can reduce social inefficiency from demand uncertainty and market power in the context of the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Market power generates misalignment between firm profit-maximizing capacity investments and welfare-maximizing capacity investments. To quantify the extent of this inefficiency and explore how various forms of supply coordination can mitigate it, we estimate a static structural model of semiconductor demand and a dynamic model of supply-side investment in technology and capacity. The data we have assembled to perform this exercise are, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive data on the industry in academic research. We obtain: (i) detailed proprietary buyer-level product demand data, covering around 20% of world orders, from 2004 to 2015, and (ii) proprietary world-wide, plant-level technology and capacity investment in semiconductor manufacturing plants from 1995 to 2015. We compare in counterfactual scenarios the relative efficacy of various forms of supply coordination (e.g., social planner, monopoly manufacturer, coordination on technology and capacity investment but competition in product market) in reducing inefficiency.

Our prior research (Murciano-Goroff, Zhuo, Greenstein, 2021) documented webserver usage across the US economy over the last two decades and identified enormous heterogeneity in the propensity to upgrade web server software. We investigate the causes of this heterogeneity in upgrades. We focus on quasi-natural experiments after the appearance of a severe security bug, and we analyze empirically why firms accelerate their rate of upgrading webserver software when a severe bug arises. A reverse causality issue arises due to a correlation between the (low) propensity to upgrade and a (high) prevalence of software that contains known security vulnerabilities. We develop hazard model approaches that account for firm-specific propensities to upgrade. We find that firms accelerate upgrading when their webserver supports electronic commerce instead of providing merely an informational or coordinating role. We also find acceleration when firms have recently displayed an unusually good financial performance. Finally, we find a significant propensity to upgrade merely because a new version has appeared, suggesting many firms gain protection against bugs as a byproduct of routine administrative processes that support maintaining frontier software.

**How the market segmentation affect the regional economic resilience** 
(with YangGe). 2023.

Strengthening economic resilience and ensuring steady and sustained economic development are important goals for China as it enters a new stage of development. Building a unified market and breaking down the regional market segmentation is the internal requirement of building a new development stage. This paper theoretically analyzes the internal logic of the impact of market segmentation on regional economic resilience, and empirically tests it using China's provincial panel data from 2005 to 2019. It is found that market segmentation has a significant adverse effect on economic resilience, which is still significant after a series of robustness tests excluding the endogeneity problem. Mechanism test shows that regional market segmentation will affect economic resilience by inhibiting manufacturing scale and regional innovation capacity, and market segmentation will also make infrastructure investment tend to be inefficient, which will affect economic resilience. The negative effect of market segmentation on economic resilience is strengthened in regions with a high degree of private and individual enterprise development; With the transformation and upgrading of industrial structure, the destruction of market function caused by market segmentation will intensify the adverse impact on economic resilience. The development of digital economy is an effective way to alleviate the negative impact of market segmentation.

**Market Determinism, Government Transformation and Government Economics with Chinese Characteristics**

This paper discusses the revolutionary significance of giving full play to the decisive role of the market in resource allocation and the role of the government in perfecting the socialist market economy system with Chinese characteristics pointed out in the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China; the core issue of "market determinism" is the relationship between the government and the market, and the reorientation of government functions and the transformation of government are the core of contemporary China's economic system reform "Market determinism" does not weaken government functions, but puts forward higher requirements for government functions. It is an urgent academic task to construct government economics with Chinese characteristics. The paper also puts forward corresponding suggestions on the research content, discipline construction and scientific research cooperation of government economics with Chinese characteristics.
