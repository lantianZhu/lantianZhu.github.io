I am a PhD Candidate in Nanjing University. I have broad and deep research interests at the urban, region and development. My two accepted papers have examined regional resilience and financial system. My current and future research will broadly look at poverty gap and recession. I use a variety of methods, including reduced-form analysis, machine learning, and dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium.
