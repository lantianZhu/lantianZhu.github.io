I’m currently a PhD candidate and expected to get my Econ-PhD from Nanjing University in June 2024. My academic performance is excellent and
I kept winning academic scholarships for many years. I naturally love exploring the world and doing research. I have a wide
vision and my research interests focus on China economic issues,urban and recessions . I have already published a few dissertations
for now as I list out in my resume.
I’m very skilled at economic analysis, data science. More importantly, I get the ability to think independently, which
enables me to analyze and think more deeply about the nature of problems.
I have an optimistic and strong personality. I trust that my ability comes from long-term concentration and effort. For
me the progress of science and technology is what make true value for human beings and I always think tomorrow will be
better.I truly insist that what defines a person depends on his contribution to the world.I always follow the principle of being
honesty and make everything open when Iwork, which makes communication simple and effective. I love to stay outside and
embrace nature.Running, camping and swimming are my lifetime hobbies which make me energetic.
I’m ambitious and determined to be extraordinary. I know what it takes and I’ll embrace it with great passion.I look
forward to talk to you face to face.
